Thank you for purchasing my music pack, RPG Music Starter Pack!

This file has just a couple of recommendations for using some of the tracks.

For Cave Dungeon and Ice Dungeon, I recommend playing these at lower volumes if possible as they will create a more mysterious atmosphere.
For Bustling Town, Battle Theme, and Boss Theme, I highly recommend using the clean intro, then move immediately to the LOOP version and loop it.
	Bustling Town and Boss Theme both have pretty substantial unique introductions that are not part of the loop that benefit the
	track's execution overall. Battle Theme also has a pretty long unique introduction, but not as much as the other two.
	
In general, I recommend playing the clean intro version and then looping the LOOP version for the most seamless experience. The LOOP version
	will work by itself, but the beggining will not be as clean sounding.
